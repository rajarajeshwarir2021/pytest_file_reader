# pytest_file_reader

`pytest_file_reader` is a Python-based application designed to read and process files while providing tests using the `pytest` framework. The goal of this project is to create a simple, reliable way to read file contents and validate them through automated tests.

## Features

- Read various file formats (e.g., `.txt`, `.csv`, `.json`)
- Simple file processing functions (e.g., reading, parsing)
- Integrated unit tests with `pytest`
- Easy to extend for custom file handling

## Installation

To use `pytest_file_reader`, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash

cd pytest_file_reader
```

### 2. Install the required dependencies:
You can use pip to install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set up the environment (if necessary):

venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
```

### 4. Usage
To read files using the pytest_file_reader library, you can use the following methods:

Example:
```bash
from pytest_file_reader import read_csv_file

file_contents = read_csv_file('sample.txt')
print(file_contents)
```

For more detailed usage and advanced functionality, check out the source code in the pytest_file_reader.py file.

### 5. Running Tests
To run the tests for this application using pytest, execute the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

This will automatically discover and run all tests in the tests/ directory.
Tests are located in the tests/ directory. You can add more tests to verify the behavior of different file-reading scenarios or edge cases.
